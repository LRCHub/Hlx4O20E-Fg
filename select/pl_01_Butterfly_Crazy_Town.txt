Come, my lady.
Come, come, my lady.
You're my butterfly,
Sugar baby.
Come, my lady.
Come, come, my lady.
You're my butterfly,
Sugar baby.
Such a sexy, sexy, pretty
little thing.
Fierce nipple pierce...
You got me sprung with your
tongue ring,
And I ain't gonna lie 'cause
your loving gets me high.
So, to keep you by my side,
There's nothing that I won't
try.
Butterflies in her eyes and the
looks to kill...
Time is passing. I'm asking,
"Could this be real?"
'Cause I can't sleep. I can't
hold still.
The only thing I really know is
she got sex appeal I can feel.
Too much is never enough.
You're always there to lift me
up
When these times get rough.
I was lost. Now I'm found.
Ever since you've been around...
You're the woman that I want,
So, yo, I'm putting it down.
Come, my lady.
Come, come, my lady.
You're my butterfly,
Sugar baby.
Come, my lady.
You're my pretty baby.
I'll make your legs shake.
You make me go crazy.
Come, my lady.
Come, come, my lady.
You're my butterfly,
Sugar baby.
Come, my lady.
You're my pretty baby.
I'll make your legs shake.
You make me go crazy.
I don't deserve you
Unless it's some kind of hidden
message
To show me life is precious.
Then I guess it's true.
But to tell the truth, I really
never knew 'til I met you.
See, I was lost and confused,
Twisted and used up.
Knew a better life existed but
thought that I missed it.
My lifestyle's wild.
I was living like a wild child,
Trapped on a short leash,
Parole. The police files...
So, yo, what's happening now?
I see the sun breaking down a
few dark clouds
And a vision of you standing
out in a crowd. So...
Come, my lady.
Come, come, my lady.
You're my butterfly,
Sugar baby.
Come, my lady.
You're my pretty baby.
I'll make your legs shake.
You make me go crazy.
Come, my lady.
Come, come, my lady.
You're my butterfly,
Sugar baby.
Come, my lady.
You're my pretty baby.
I'll make your legs shake.
You make me go crazy.
Hey, sugar momma, come and
dance with me.
The smartest thing you ever did
was take a chance with me.
Whatever tickles your fancy...
Girl, it's me and you like Sid
and Nancy.
So sexy, almost evil...
Talk about butterflies in my
head.
I used to think that happy
endings were only in the books
I read,
But you made me feel alive when
I was almost dead.
You filled that empty space
with the love I used to chase,
And as far as I can see, it
don't get better than this.
So, butterfly, here is a song,
And it's sealed with a kiss and
a "thank you, miss."
Come and dance with me.
Come and dance with me.
Come and dance with me.
So, come and dance with me.
(Uh-huh, uh-huh.)
Come, my lady.
Come, come, my lady.
You're my butterfly,
Sugar baby.
Come, my lady.
You're my pretty baby.
I'll make your legs shake.
You make me go crazy.
Come, my lady.
Come, come, my lady.
You're my butterfly,
Sugar baby.
Come, my lady.
You're my pretty baby.
I'll make your legs shake.
You make me go crazy.
Come, my lady.
Come, come, my lady.
You're my butterfly,
Sugar baby.
Come, my lady.
You're my pretty baby.
I'll make your legs shake.
You make me go crazy.
Come, my lady.
Come, come, my lady.
You're my butterfly,
Sugar baby.
Come, my lady.
You're my pretty baby.
I'll make your legs shake.
You make me go crazy.
